## Key Lessons from Netflix's Use of Microservices
Netflix's migration from a monolithic architecture to microservices addressed scalability, bug localization, and single points of failure. Their microservices architecture helps manage dependencies, scale effectively, and handle variance in operations.

### Dependency Management
Strategies include the use of circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures and designing API gateways to avoid becoming monolithic.

### Scaling Techniques
Netflix emphasizes stateless services to improve resilience and uses consistent hashing for effective workload distribution.

### Handling Variance
Continuous learning and automation are crucial to managing operational drift and ensuring system stability.
