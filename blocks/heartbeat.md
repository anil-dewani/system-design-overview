# Summary of Heartbeat Pattern in Distributed Systems

## Introduction
The Heartbeat pattern ensures the availability of servers within a cluster by periodically sending a signal to demonstrate that a server is alive.

## Problem Addressed
This pattern helps detect server failures promptly within a cluster, allowing for quick reassignment of responsibilities to other servers to maintain data availability and service continuity.

## Implementation
Servers send periodic heartbeat signals, with timing set to account for network delays. Listening servers wait for these heartbeats and may initiate failover processes if heartbeats are missed.
