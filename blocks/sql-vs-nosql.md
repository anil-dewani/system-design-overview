# Summary of SQL vs NoSQL: 5 Critical Differences

## Overview
Understanding the distinction between SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL databases is crucial for modern data management. SQL databases are relational, using a predefined schema for structured data, while NoSQL databases are non-relational, flexible, and suited for unstructured data.

## Key Differences
1. **Database Structure**: SQL uses tables and rows; NoSQL uses documents, key-values, or graphs.
2. **Scalability**: SQL is vertically scalable; NoSQL is horizontally scalable.
3. **Flexibility**: SQL requires a fixed schema; NoSQL schemas are dynamic.
4. **Transactions**: SQL excels in multi-row transactions; NoSQL handles large, unstructured datasets better.
5. **Use Cases**: SQL is preferred for complex queries and accuracy, while NoSQL offers performance and scalability for large data volumes.

## When to Use Which
Choose SQL for applications needing complex queries and transaction consistency. Opt for NoSQL for flexibility, scalability, and handling large volumes of data.
