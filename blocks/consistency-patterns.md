# Summary of Consistency Patterns in Distributed Systems

## Overview
Consistency patterns are crucial in distributed systems to manage data storage and ensure reliability and user experience. They affect how data propagates across systems, influencing scalability and reliability.

## Key Consistency Models
- **Strong Consistency**: Ensures immediate visibility of data across all nodes post-update, ideal for systems requiring high data accuracy but impacts latency and availability.
- **Eventual Consistency**: Offers high availability and performance, with updates becoming visible across nodes over time. Suitable for systems where immediate consistency can be compromised.
- **Weak Consistency**: Provides the fastest performance by allowing data to be inconsistently accessed immediately after an update.

## Choosing a Pattern
The choice of consistency pattern should align with system requirements and specific use cases, balancing between consistency, availability, and latency to meet different needs.
