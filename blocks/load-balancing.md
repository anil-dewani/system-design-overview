# Summary of Load Balancing

## Definition of Load Balancing
Load balancing distributes network traffic across multiple servers to improve responsiveness and availability of applications.

## Benefits
- **Availability**: Minimizes application downtime.
- **Scalability**: Handles traffic efficiently with multiple servers.
- **Security**: Provides a defense against certain cyber threats.
- **Performance**: Improves response time and reduces latency.

## Load Balancing Algorithms
Algorithms include round-robin, least connections, and IP hash, which help in efficient traffic distribution based on server status or predefined rules.

## Types of Load Balancing
- **Application Load Balancing**: Analyzes content to direct traffic.
- **Network Load Balancing**: Focuses on IP protocol data.
- **Global Server Load Balancing**: Manages traffic across global servers.

## Technologies
- **Hardware Load Balancers**: Physical devices managing traffic.
- **Software Load Balancers**: Flexible, cloud-compatible software solutions.

## AWS Load Balancing
AWS offers Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) that distributes incoming traffic across AWS and on-premises resources. ELB includes several types, such as Application, Network, Gateway, and Classic Load Balancers, catering to different needs.
