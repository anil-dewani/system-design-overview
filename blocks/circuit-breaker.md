# Summary of the Circuit Breaker Pattern in Microservices

## Overview
The Circuit Breaker pattern is a design pattern used in microservices to prevent a network or service failure from cascading to other parts of the system. It acts like an electrical circuit breaker, stopping the flow of operations to a particular service when failures reach a certain threshold.

## How It Works
- **Detection**: Automatically detects failures in calls to a service.
- **State Management**: Switches between three states—closed, open, and half-open—to control the service requests.
- **Recovery**: Allows a limited number of test requests in the half-open state to determine if the underlying problem is fixed.

## Benefits
- Enhances system resilience by limiting the impact of failures.
- Reduces the risk of system overload by preventing repeated failed calls.
