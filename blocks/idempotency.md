# Summary of Idempotency in API Design

## What is Idempotency?
Idempotency ensures that an operation, when performed multiple times, has the same effect as if it were done once. This concept is vital for reliability in APIs and distributed systems.

## Importance
Idempotency is crucial in APIs to avoid unintended effects from repeated requests, such as during network issues.

## Idempotent vs. Safe Methods
Not all idempotent methods are safe. Safe methods do not alter the state but idempotent ones might.

## HTTP Methods and Idempotency
- **GET, PUT, DELETE**: Idempotent; safe to repeat.
- **POST**: Generally non-idempotent, could yield different results on repetition.
