# Proxy Server Overview

## Definition and Purpose
- A proxy server acts as an intermediary between clients and servers, requesting resources on behalf of clients.

## Types of Proxy Servers
- **Forward Proxy**: Manages requests from clients to the internet.
- **Reverse Proxy**: Directs client requests to internal network servers, often for load balancing.

## Functions in System Design
- **Security**: Enhances security by hiding client IPs and enforcing network policies.
- **Performance**: Caches content to speed up request processing and reduce load on origin servers.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure stability and availability.

## Protocols Supported
- Common protocols include HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS, and FTP.

## Use Cases
- Used in content filtering, web anonymity, and geo-restriction bypassing.

## Challenges
- Introduces additional complexity in network configuration and can become a bottleneck if not properly managed.

This summary provides a broad view of proxy servers with key details about their roles and implications in system design.
