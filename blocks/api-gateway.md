# Summary of "What Is an API Gateway?" from NGINX

## Overview
- An API Gateway acts as a bridge between clients and services, centralizing API communications and handling in a structured way.

## Key Functions
- Handles requests by routing to appropriate services, translating protocols, and combining responses to simplify client interactions.

## Benefits
- Simplifies app architecture, speeds up deployment, and streamlines policy enforcement through centralized management.

## Use in Microservices
- Vital in microservices architecture for aggregating service responses and managing routing and policies.

## Integration with Kubernetes
- Can be deployed as a part of Kubernetes, managing connectivity and security at various levels (cluster, edge, service mesh).

## API Gateway vs. API Management
- Distinguishes between API gateways (handling API calls) and API management (overseeing API lifecycle and policies).
