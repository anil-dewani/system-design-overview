## Databases

**Definition:** Databases are organized collections of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. They allow for the efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of data with queries.

### Types of Databases

1. **Relational Database (RDBMS)** - Utilizes tables and supports SQL for queries and operations.
2. **NoSQL Database** - Designed for unstructured data with dynamic schemas for scalability.
3. **NewSQL Database** - Combines the scalability features of NoSQL with the transactional guarantees of RDBMS.
4. **Graph Database** - Optimized for storing and querying data that represents networks of interconnected elements.
5. **Key-Value Store** - Simple database that uses a unique key to associate with a value.
6. **Document Store** - Stores semi-structured data as documents, typically using JSON or XML formats.
7. **Wide-Column Store** - Stores data in columns instead of rows, suitable for analyzing large datasets.
8. **Object-oriented Database** - Stores data in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming.
9. **Time Series Database** - Optimized for handling data indexed in time order, ideal for analytics over time.
10. **In-memory Database** - Stores data in main memory to provide faster response times and data processing.
11. **Distributed Database** - Manages the database across multiple physical locations, improving reliability and accessibility.
12. **Multi-model Database** - Supports multiple data models against a single, integrated backend.
13. **Cloud Database** - Database services that are built and accessed through cloud computing platforms.
14. **Columnar Database** - Optimized for reading and writing data in columns, enhancing data compression and access speed.
15. **Autonomous Database** - Uses machine learning to automate tuning, security, and backup tasks.
