# Techniques for Scaling Applications with a Database

## Overview
Scaling applications with databases involves various techniques to handle increased load and data volume, ensuring performance and availability.

## Common Strategies
- **Vertical Scaling**: Increasing the capacity of the server (CPU, RAM, storage).
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more database servers to distribute the load.
- **Partitioning**: Dividing a database into smaller, manageable pieces.
- **Replication**: Copying data across multiple database servers to ensure availability and redundancy.
- **Caching**: Storing copies of frequently accessed data to reduce database load.
