# Summary of Data Replication

## What is Data Replication?
Data replication involves copying data from one location to another to ensure consistency and support high availability, performance, and disaster recovery.

## Types of Data Replication
- **Full Replication**: Copies the entire database.
- **Partial Replication**: Copies only essential parts of the data.
- **Transactional Replication**: Real-time copying of changes.
- **Snapshot Replication**: Copies data at a specific moment in time.
- **Merge Replication**: Combines data from multiple sources.
- **Key-Based Replication**: Updates parts of data using a specific key.

## Benefits
- Enhances data availability and system reliability.
- Improves read performance by distributing data across multiple locations.
- Supports disaster recovery strategies.
