Caching is a system design concept that takes advantage of the locality of reference principle - recently requested data is likely to be requested again. Caches exist at various levels of a system architecture, often closest to the front-end. Caching involves precalculating results, pre-generating indexes, and storing frequently accessed data in faster backends. There are different types of caching systems like write-through, write-around, and write-back, each with their own tradeoffs. Common cache eviction policies include LRU, LFU, and random replacement. Caching can be implemented as a global cache or a distributed cache system.

- Caching takes advantage of the locality of reference principle - recently requested data is likely to be requested again.
- Caches exist at various levels of the system architecture, often closest to the front-end.
- Caching involves precalculating results, pre-generating indexes, and storing frequently accessed data in faster backends.
- Different types of caches include client-side, DNS, web server, application, database, and content delivery network (CDN) caches.
- Cache invalidation is important to ensure data consistency when the underlying data is modified. There are different cache invalidation strategies like write-through, write-around, and write-back.
- Common cache eviction policies include FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, LFU, and random replacement.
- Global caches use a single shared cache space, while distributed caches partition the cache across multiple nodes.
- When designing a cache system, considerations include the data structures used, handling cache misses, and replication/redundancy.
- Caching can significantly improve performance by reducing latency, but requires careful design to handle consistency, eviction, and scalability.
- Caching is a fundamental system design concept that is applied at multiple layers of a system architecture.
