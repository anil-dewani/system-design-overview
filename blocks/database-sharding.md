# Summary of Database Sharding: Concepts & Examples

## What is Database Sharding?
Database sharding is a type of horizontal scaling that distributes data across multiple servers or locations to manage large datasets and improve performance.

## Key Points
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Sharding is a strategy for scaling out by adding more nodes to handle increased load.
- **Types of Sharding**: Includes methods like range-based, hash-based, and geographic sharding.
- **Benefits**: Increases throughput, storage capacity, and availability.
- **Challenges**: Introduces complexity in query handling, system administration, and increased costs.
