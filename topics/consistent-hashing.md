# Consistent Hashing

## Conceptual Overview of Consistent Hashing

Consistent Hashing is a technique used in distributed systems to evenly distribute data across multiple nodes with minimal reorganization when nodes are added or removed. It is particularly useful in distributed cache systems and maintaining load balance.

### Sub-Topics and Connections

1. **Hash Ring**: Consistent hashing uses a virtual circle called a "hash ring" where both data and servers are mapped using a hash function.
2. **Minimal Movement**: Only a minimal amount of data is moved when servers are added or removed, which makes it efficient.
3. **Scalability**: It enables scalable and efficient redistribution of data with fewer disruptions in a dynamic network environment.

These components ensure that consistent hashing provides a stable, efficient data management technique in distributed systems, particularly when nodes are frequently added or removed.

## Real-Life Example: Mobile App Development in Swift

Consider a mobile app that requires a distributed session management system to handle user sessions across multiple servers. Using consistent hashing can help efficiently distribute sessions and maintain load balance across the servers.

### Steps for Implementing Consistent Hashing in the App:

1. **Define a Hash Function**: Choose a hash function that uniformly distributes keys across the hash ring.
2. **Map Servers to the Hash Ring**: Use the hash function to map server identifiers to positions on the hash ring.
3. **Map Sessions to the Hash Ring**: Similarly, map session identifiers to positions on the hash ring.
4. **Session Lookup**: For each session request, the app finds the nearest server clockwise on the ring to handle the session.
5. **Handling Server Changes**: When adding or removing servers, only the sessions mapped near the changing point on the ring need reassignment.

By implementing consistent hashing, the app can efficiently handle user sessions, ensuring even load distribution and minimal disruption when scaling servers.

## Conclusion

Consistent hashing is a crucial technique for data distribution in distributed systems, allowing for scalable and manageable growth with minimal overhead. Its application, from caching systems to load balancing, highlights its versatility and efficiency, making it a staple in modern system architecture, especially in environments where server changes are frequent.
