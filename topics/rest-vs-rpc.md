## REST vs RPC in API Design

### Conceptual Understanding

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** and **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)** are two fundamental approaches for designing APIs that allow systems to communicate over the internet. While both have their applications, they differ significantly in principles, structure, and implementation.

#### REST:
REST is an architectural style that emphasizes a stateless communication process where calls are made over HTTP using standard methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). It treats data as resources, each uniquely identifiable via URIs.

#### RPC:
RPC, on the other hand, involves calling specific procedures or methods on the server, where the client needs to know the procedure names and parameters beforehand. It is more about actions and performing specific tasks remotely.

### Sub-Topics and Connections

1. **Principles and Architecture**
   - **REST**: Follows a set of constraints like statelessness, client-server architecture, and a uniform interface which enhances scalability and performance. The use of standard HTTP methods ensures that REST APIs are easily understood and interacted with.
   - **RPC**: Focuses on performing specific functions or procedures remotely, which can be more straightforward for developers when actions rather than data management are required.

2. **Communication Style**
   - **REST**: Uses standard HTTP verbs which correspond to CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations, making it suitable for direct manipulation of data.
   - **RPC**: Calls are made to specific procedures, often using POST for different actions, which can simplify the execution of complex operations but at the cost of flexibility.

3. **Data Handling and Formats**
   - **REST**: Can handle multiple data formats and is generally used with JSON for web APIs. It is flexible in handling different types of data.
   - **RPC**: Typically uses a fixed data format specified by the server, such as JSON-RPC or XML-RPC, which might limit flexibility in some scenarios.

### Real-Life Example: Mobile App Development in Swift

Consider a mobile app developed in Swift that needs to interact with a server to manage user data and perform specific actions like sending notifications.

#### REST Implementation:
- A RESTful service could manage user data where endpoints like `/users/{id}` allow for retrieving, updating, or deleting a user’s information.
- CRUD operations correspond to HTTP methods: GET (retrieve), POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE (delete).

#### RPC Implementation:
- An RPC service might provide endpoints like `/sendNotification` where the client sends a POST request with necessary parameters (e.g., user ID and message content) to trigger a notification on the server side.

### Steps for Practical Implementation

**Developing a RESTful Service in Swift:**
1. **Define Resource Endpoints**: Set up endpoints like `/users`, `/users/{id}` for different user-related operations.
2. **Implement HTTP Methods**: Code the logic for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE in your server-side application to handle requests according to REST principles.
3. **Use URLSession for Networking**: In your Swift app, use URLSession to make asynchronous HTTP calls to these endpoints.

**Developing an RPC Style Service in Swift:**
1. **Define RPC Methods**: Create specific methods on the server like `addUser`, `deleteUser`, etc.
2. **Handle POST Requests**: Each method might only use POST requests where the request body contains all necessary parameters.
3. **Call Methods Using URLSession**: From your Swift app, make POST requests to these methods, sending required data as JSON in the request body.

Both REST and RPC have their merits, and choosing between them depends on the specific requirements of your application, such as whether you need to manage resources directly or perform specific operations more efficiently&#8203;``【oaicite:3】``&#8203;&#8203;``【oaicite:2】``&#8203;&#8203;``【oaicite:1】``&#8203;&#8203;``【oaicite:0】``&#8203;.
